# host protein sequence

> [UniProt Q9BYF1 entry](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9BYF1/entry)

Sequence downloaded to [Q9BYF1.fasta](./Q9BYF1.fasta).

Isoform 2 only found on infected cells, replaces first 356 residues with `MREAGWDKGG`. Therefore, it's probably in there where the virus spike protein binds.
