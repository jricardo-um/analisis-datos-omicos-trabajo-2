We have a file with the sequence DPP4, dipeptidyl peptidase-4, or also called CD26 is an enzyme found on the surface of many cells in the human body and plays an important role in the regulation of metabolic function and the immune system. DPP4 is a protein that belongs to the family of peptidase enzymes, which are responsible for the hydrolysis of peptides and proteins in the body.
The study of this protein is related to the way it attacks the Mers-CoV virus, as the MERS-CoV Spike protein is found on the surface of the Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV), which is a type of coronavirus that causes severe respiratory disease in humans. This Spike protein is responsible for the entry of the virus into human cells during infection.

The MERS-CoV Spike protein has been shown to interact with the DPP4 protein on the surface of human cells as the virus receptor. The MERS-CoV Spike protein specifically binds to the DPP4 protein on the cell surface as a crucial step for virus entry into host cells. This interaction is required for MERS-CoV infection and is a key step in the viral infection process.

Once the MERS-CoV Spike protein binds to the DPP4 protein on the cell surface, it triggers a series of events that allow entry of the virus into the host cell, including fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane and release of the virus' genetic material into the cell. This leads to virus replication and the spread of infection.
The interaction between the MERS-CoV Spike protein and the DPP4 protein is a potential target for the development of therapeutic and preventive strategies against MERS-CoV infection. For example, inhibitors of the Spike protein and the DPP4 protein have been investigated as possible approaches to block viral entry into cells and prevent MERS-CoV infection. However, more research is still needed to fully understand the interaction between these proteins and their potential application in the treatment or prevention of MERS-CoV infection.

In this section we will try to discover possible reservoirs of this virus from the DPP4 protein, a reservoir being a place where an organism or substance can remain latent, persistent or active, and from where it can be released or transmitted to other organisms.

For this, we will use the sequence of the DPP4 protein present in Homo sapiens. We will use the Blastn tool present on the Galaxy server in order to align with the different species whose sequences are similar or intrinsically related to the spread of the virus. These sequences that we are going to match can be found in a protein database such as Uniprot, which is the one we have used.

In this search we have found different types of animal species:

MERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus (transmitted between animals and humans). It is believed that humans can be infected by direct contact but at present it has only been shown to occur  with infected dromedary camels in the Middle East or their milk, urine or other body fluids.  Bats are a likely original reservoir; coronaviruses similar to MERS-CoV have been identified in bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus), but epidemiologic evidence of their role in transmission is lacking.
