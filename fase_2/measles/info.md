# Data
We have taken the primary sequence source from [UniProtKB/P15144](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P15144/entry) :
  - [P15144.fasta](./P15144-fasta)

With these file we began this study about the infection of coronviruses in other potentially infective species. P15144 is the ID code of human aminopeptidase (h(APN)) in UniProt database. The h(APN) is the well know receptor of Human-Cov-229E which is a virus knows to cause a common cold. There are another species that have this receptor with their genetic sequences. 

# Methodology 

Initially we used the `blastp` function on the initial fasta document to allign all the sequences.
